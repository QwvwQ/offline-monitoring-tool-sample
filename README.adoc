== How to run this mock application

=== Run with Maven:

 mvn spring-boot:run

=== Command to retrieve a status: use wget

 wget http://localhost:8080/datamanager/offlinestatus --http-password=password --http-user=user --auth-no-challenge

=== Authentication

Login / pwd are hardcoded for now: "user" / "password"

=== Available endpoints:

* http://localhost:8080/datamanager/offlinestatus
 
* http://localhost:8080/datamanager/studies

* http://localhost:8080/offlineinstance/offlinestatus
 
* http://localhost:8080/offlineinstance/offlinetechnicalstatus
 
* http://localhost:8080/datamanager/studies

* http://localhost:8080/datamanager/studies/<2> (replace the number with an existing studyIUID)
 
* http://localhost:8080/datamanager/workflows/
 
* http://localhost:8080/datamanager/workflows/<workflow_breast>/<1> ( "workflow_breast" represents an existing workflow id,
"1" represents a study on which we want to start the WF, must be accessed through PUT)
 
== Known limitations

* Data returned are fake and always the same (except for the dates)
* For now:
** HTTPS is not implemented
** Basic auth is the only auth method
